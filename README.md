# HomeAutoSys (Home Automation System) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mob41/HomeAutoSys.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mob41/HomeAutoSys)
Home Automation System designed for Home Automation. My goal is to program this system to be a professional automated controller.

##What is this used for?
Home automation is a system controlled by computers/modules which automate your things. For example, when you are so tried one day, you can just enter the house. The system will help you to turn on the lights automatically. And you can sleep on the sofa and relax. Once you leave the house, the system will turn off all the lights and home appliances.
The system is totally customized, you can edit your favourite scene and actions, even internal settings and internal terminal. The system will also include a web server, which allows you to turn off/on appliances on the web easily.
